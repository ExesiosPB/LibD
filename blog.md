# Flikr
So flikr will make it pretty easy to get pictures based on location easy to just call `flickr.photos.search` with some criteria such as tags and location, some external libraries out there at the moment, but surely you can make a request to the url?

So far it returns a json of photo stuff, this needs to be translated to the actual images
